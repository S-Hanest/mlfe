# mlfe : Modeling Learnable Feature Extractor  
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shi510/mlfe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shi510/mlfe)  
  
The goal of this project is to build a model that can learn feature.  
The language mainly used is c++.  
We first start with convolutional model and will add other models.  
Please don't hesitate to improve this project.
